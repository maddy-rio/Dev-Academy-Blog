        <strong>Who am I?</strong>

        I think that exploring who I am and actually talking about it is very
        important in this chapter of my life. I have put in so much hard work
        mentally over the past couple years to really change my mindset and
        re-evaluate what I want to do with my life. I'm very much trying to get
        comfortable with change, get comfortable with not being perfect, and try
        to find a good balance in all aspects of my life. There's so many things
        I want to do and achieve so it's important for me to be ticking boxes in
        all areas of life and not just focus on one thing at a time with
        intensity. Here's to balance and self exploration at 22 years young!

        <strong>Personal Values</strong>
        I took a personal values test online and the top 5 values I resonated
        with were as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Family</li>
        <li>Love</li>
        <li>Health</li>
        <li>Financial Stability</li>
        <li>Independence</li>
      </ol>
      <br />

      <p>
        <strong>Family:</strong>
        Family is so important to me, I'm very close with my mum and pretty
        close with my sisters and nephew. I always enjoy spending time with them
        doing simple things such as going for walks, lunch dates, and talking
        about how things are going with them. I have never had very many friends
        (which I'm now totally comfortable with), so it's nice to have a family
        that I am close with and can rely on no matter what. With my nephew now
        in the family too, I feel like this has bought us all a little bit
        closer which I am grateful for. My sister and nephew are currently
        living in Tauranga but may be moving back to the Bay soon which I am so
        excited for! I also have to remember to put myself first and set aside
        time for myself over family as that is so important for my health too. I
        love my mama bear and she is the reason us girls have stuck so closely
        together.
      </p>
      <br />
      <img src="../images/love.png" alt="Family Values" width="350px" />
      <p>
        <strong>Love:</strong>
        Love is the second value that came in strongly for me after this quiz.
        Love and being kind and caring is also important to me and has been an
        emotion that I have struggled embracing and understanding in the past.
        As important as it is to show this emotion towards other people that are
        close in your life, I think it's most important to show deep love and
        caring for yourself. This is the current journey that I am on and I can
        confirm this is and will be a very long journey. I'm starting to show
        love to myself in many ways such as actually listening to what I want,
        eating things that make me feel good and moving my body to feel good. It
        took me such a long time to get to this place and I'm proud of myself.

      <p>
        <strong>Health:</strong>
        I have let myself go over the past couple years and am now realising how
        important health is to me, I just didn't have the right approach to
        maintain good health initially. I would often have extreme approaches to
        exercise and dieting but realistically health means so much more than
        being a certain weight. It's about how you're feeling, creating
        something that's maintainable for you, and making sure you can still
        balance this with other activities. I have been through a lot and made
        so many mistakes with my health, but at the end of the day that is what
        has gotten me to the point I am at now.

      />
      <p>
        <strong>Financial Stability: </strong>
        Financial Stability has become a lot more important to me recently - I
        associate this with being comfortable, stress free, and having more free
        time freedom to do things I enjoy. I would like to have nice things also
        but a nice house is the most important asset for me. I also like trying
        new things and want to travel so having better control over my money is
        what I'm working towards. Being more self aware so I can work on saving
        and investing money towards my future is another focus.
      </p>
      <br />
      <img src="../images/independence.png" alt="Family Values" width="350px" />
      <p>
        <strong>Independence:</strong>
        Independence and self reliance is also very important. I want to know I
        can rely on myself and not need to rely on anyone else for anything as I
        don't like to hold expectations to people as that often leads to
        disappointment. I want to be self-sufficient and push myself to create
        the good future I know I'm capable of. I'm smart and I know there are
        great things out there waiting for me, and I'll get them once I'm ready
        for it.

            Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now -
          </em>
        </strong>
        a small example of an ethical decision I made recently was telling the
        receptionist all of the things we took from the mini bar during our stay
        at a hotel in Auckland. The optimal and ethical choice was to be honest
        and tell them all of the things we took from the mini bar overnight so
        we could settle our bill at once. The receptionists show trust in simply
        asking us whether we took anything from the mini bar and I believe we
        should be showing the same trust back in letting them know all the items
        we took. It was a small ethical act but it displays honestly. Reflecting
        on this decision now, it was the right decision and supported my values.
        We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would like to stay there again so
        would not like to cause any issues.

        </strong>
        the people you surround yourself with or even your family absolutely
        influence your values and identity strongly. I think I’ve always been
        quite a strong minded and determined individual so I won’t let others
        affect my core values. However, having a split family I have had two
        different family dynamics to look at and observe. So both sides of my
        family are quite set in their ways of thinking but ultimately one side
        of my family is more kind and caring and the other side a bit more
        selfish. I have really had the time to reflect on the different values
        and behaviors each side of my family has to determine the kind of person
        I want to be. I am kind, caring, ambitious, smart, actively learning,
        modest and more. I have a desire to be financially comfortable and have
        nice things which is not greedy as the poor often think. I ultimately
        have picked up on the things I agree with to decide the type of person I
        want to be.

        I am a very determined person with a balanced approach to learning new
        things which I think will take me very far in software development.
        Being balanced and working smarter, not harder are all things that align
        with me and I believe will help me succeed. Having a more balanced
        approach will help me make sure I'm still taking care of other aspects
        of my life while giving the necessary time and dedication to this
        learning journey. Another strength that I am currently developing is
        being comfortable making mistakes! You learn so much more when you make
        mistakes and break things with software development. And even better,
        the answer to fixing your situation is always a google away.

        </strong>
        I think the biggest limitation I have is self confidence. This affects
        all areas of my life but this is something I can definitely improve. If
        I don't push myself out of my comfort zone in terms of confidence and
        putting myself out there in team situations, that will negatively impact
        my learning journey. I owe it to myself to share with everyone my
        knowledge and believe in myself more than I currently do.

            what other strategies you would try now and why -
          </em>
        </strong>
        When I was working in retail I was a keyholder and often in charge of
        others on shift when the manager wasn't there so I would usually be
        working with others on my own and be in charge of making sure we were
        working productively and thinking of things we could do during quiet
        times. For a period of time I was working with one or two people that
        wouldn't take the initiative to find something to do if it were quiet,
        and I could sense tension and resistance when I would ask them to do
        things as I was a bit younger than they were. From this point I started
        thinking of tasks in the morning before they would arrive and write
        lists of the things each of us needed to complete during our shift in
        down time so we always had something to do. I found that having a list
        decreased friction because I didn't need to actively ask them to do
        something they could go off on their own and do the things that needed
        to be done independently. I found this really useful as they were able
        to tick things off as they went which also gives you satisfaction and
        they could do so independently. Reflecting on this now I would also get
        them more actively involved in writing the lists so they could take more
        responsibility.
