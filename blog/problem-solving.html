        <strong>Blocked on a simple problem:</strong> One simple problem I
        remember being blocked on was the warm up section in the JS Olympics.
        All we had to do was add an existing object to an empty array and create
        a new object to add to the array as well. Creating a new object was no
        problem at all but I referenced a previous exercise and tried to add the
        athletes to the empty array by creating a new key within the array.
        After trying a couple different methods and it not working, I googled
        the correct way to add the athletes to the array and found that I should
        be pushing the athletes into the array using the push method. It really
        clicked and solidified this knowledge as I realised I was trying to do
        something completely different with the previous code. It was a relief
        after I got this part passed but it was definitely frustrating in the
        moment considering it was just a warm up lol.
      </p>

        <strong>Elegantly solved a problem:</strong> A problem I solved the most
        elegantly and with the least help was creating the function to remove
        odd numbers in the JS Olympics. I used google to search the best method
        to use to remove odd numbers and the most common method was filtering
        out the odd numbers using a modulo equation of num % 2 === 0. I gave
        this a go and my code still wasn't passing and I realised pretty quickly
        I still needed to return the variable but I wasn't sure if the code
        itself would work. To my surprise it did work! This was the calmest I
        felt during any of the kata challenges and I had a positive dopamine
        kick at the end especially because I didn't need as much help solving
        this one. This was definitely a point where I began to understand
        functions a bit better a there's so many different ways to implement
        functions.

      <p class="main-blocks">
        <strong>How confident I feel using problem-solving processes:</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        <em>Pseudocode -</em> I am feeling more and more confident using
        pseudocode every time I write code. It really helps me to break down the
        problem and understand what's happening more. It also really helps me to
        understand what's happening when I have found the code to a challenge
        online and want to break it down.
        <br />
        <em>Trying something -</em> this is definitely taking a bit of time to
        feel confident with as my understanding of how things work together
        isn't the best yet. But I still do keep trying different things until I
        get that passing tick.
        <br />
        <em>Rubber ducky method -</em> I'm confident using this method in
        general and it was my personal fave in my previous job and absolutely
        works to explain your problem to someone else or write it down to help
        solve the problem before you even finish explaining. I have found it a
        bit harder with coding as I really need to think about what processes
        are involved but I link this with pseudocode now and use this to support
        my problem-solving.
        <br />
        <em>Reading error messages -</em> I'm still working on this one! It took
        me a while to understand what the error messages were meaning and how
        they linked to my code from the terminal. Again, the more I have seen
        the error messages the easier it has gotten to read and recognise the
        hints in the errors. Sometimes though, I still do get confused and
        wonder how it relates but hopefully it will all make sense to me and
        I'll have a lightbulb moment.
        <br />
        <em>Console.logging -</em> I'm fine with using console logging to
        problem solve with JS web pages that I'm interacting with but I have
        found it challenging using this problem-solving technique during the
        kata challenges. I guess because we're not working with the webpage
        directly and are more working with background JS, I haven't found it as
        useful but I could be using it wrong with these challenges.
        <br />
        <em>Googling -</em> 90% confident with using google to problem-solve!
        This is my go to problem-solving technique, google and AI can help me
        understand almost anything! There's so many resources that can help you
        assist in solving problems these days. The other 10% where I'm not so
        confident really only comes down to wording the issue in a way that the
        browser will interpret my problem correctly.
        <br />
        <em>Asking your peers for help -</em> I feel ok with asking peers for
        help and I know I can get help if I do ask, however I'm more likely to
        google and use AI tools to try find the answers as I always find I need
        the most help after hours or on weekends and I'm on a mission to solve
        the problem as quick as possible so I can move on lol. Asking others for
        help is my last resort for sure.
        <br />
        <em>Asking coaches for help -</em> I am also fine with asking coaches
        for help but again, this is one of my last resorts and I usually pop my
        questions in the foundations or tech questions channel with the
        intention of getting help from anyone who knows the answer.
        <br />
        <em>Improving your process with reflection -</em> Reflecting on the
        challenges in the sprint has been really helpful for me to improve this
        problem-solving technique. It's not that I'm not confident in doing it,
        it's more a technique that gets overlooked but I find it really helps me
        to make sense of what I'm doing and what I'm learning.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p class="main-blocks">
        <strong>Reflection on asking for help:</strong> I find that I can be
        really reluctant to ask for help in the channels as I'm determined to
        try figure things out and understand on my own before asking for help.
        In a sense I do think this is a good thing because it helps to solidify
        my learning and get my brain working on finding a solution. At the same
        time it could be counter productive if I'm spending too long trying to
        understand what I'm working on. Next time this happens during day time
        hours, I will try reaching out to someone to help understand how my code
        is working or where I'm going wrong, or to simply get help understanding
        a concept.
