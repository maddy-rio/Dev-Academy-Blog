        <strong>Long term goal or career pathway:</strong> My goal is to break
        into the tech sector with a Junior Software Development role and work my
        way up from there. At this stage I'm still exploring whether I'd be more
        interested in Front-end Development or Back-end Development - haven't
        yet dived into too much JavaScript yet but I have enjoyed both sides
        from what I have learnt so far in Dev Academy and previous to this
        course. I know it will be hard and there's a lot of competition in the
        tech sector but I'm determined to make it as a Software Developer.

        <strong>Strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</strong>
        <em>Strengths:</em>
        - I know how I learn best which is seeing demonstrations of something
        and then putting it into practice myself before moving onto the next
        learning objective - focussing on one thing at a time - I'm good at
        researching/googling and checking multiple resources before asking for
        help, this helps keep me more engaged with learning - When I put my mind
        to something, I'm determined to figure out the solution preferably
        without needing to ask for help

        <em>Limitations:</em> - I'm quiet and not so confident which I'll need
        to really focus on improving to get the best out of my Dev Academy
        experience - I can get distracted quite easily which is why I need to
        reduce distractions at home - I'm good at procrastinating and doing all
        the things that are less important first

          >Human skills I would like to develop during Dev Academy:</strong
        >
        I would like to become more confident at speaking up in group situations
        and would like to learn how to communicate with others more effectively.
        This has definitely been my main focus in terms of human skills coming
        into this course. I would also like to get to know myself a bit better
        in terms of values and what I want with my life which will come hand in
        hand with developing confidence and the ability to speak up.

        <strong>Commitment to how I will manage my workload:</strong> I will
        manage my workload by sticking to a daily schedule as if I were working
        a full-time job still and using the pomodoro timer to make sure I have
        productive focus time and take breaks frequently to refresh my mind and
        increase engagement. Each day I will draft out a to do list so I know
        what tasks need to be completed daily and make sure I communicate my
        progress/any obstacles with team mates so everyone knows where I'm at.
        During this time I will also look after my own well-being by getting
        outside in the sun and going for walks daily, going to the gym/pilates
        5x per week in the morning, eating foods that will fuel my learning,
        journaling daily, and try creating an effective evening wind down
        routine for a good nights sleep. When I'm starting to feel stress
        building up, I need to first make sure I have created a to do list so I
        know where I'm at with tasks and what I still need to complete. I may
        also need to take a break from the topic to go back with a fresh
        perspective or ask for help/support. It's also often helpful to just
        talk to someone or write down notes explaining where I am stuck and talk
        it out with myself as I may be able to solve the issue myself this way.

        <strong>How and where I will seek help in a timely way:</strong> If I'm
        needing help with study related questions, there are a number of
        resources available to me with Dev Academy. There are multiple discord
        groups where I can seek help in a timely fashion from facilitators along
        with other groups where I can seek help from peers that may know the
        answers that I'm after.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>What I expect from the facilitation team:</strong> To be
        available when we need help during week days and have our weekly catch
        ups so we can all check in together as a team. To also have the
        knowledge to help educate us on any problems that may pop up while we're
        learning coding basics and to just openly be available to reach out to
        when we're having trouble.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Scheduling information:</strong> The only commitments I do
        currently have involve gym, pilates and daily walks. Gym and pilates are
        to be completed in the morning before I start my study day and my walk
        is to be completed during my lunch break. I am currently giving myself 1
        hour and 30 minutes for my lunch break so I have enough time to go for a
        long walk, shower, and have lunch. During the first two weeks I have
        struggled sticking to my schedule so I'm making some changes so I can
        stay on track better. My new and improved daily schedule from
        Monday-Friday will be focus time between 8am - 5pm with a lunch break
        between 11:30am - 1pm. I am going to set up alarms to keep me on track
        with this schedule and make sure I have a to do list prepared for what I
        need to get done in terms of both study and personal life each day. I
        also need to make sure I am getting my daily workouts in between 5am -
        7am each morning so I have time to prepare for a productive day of study
        before 8am. I expect to be at my desk completing my reflection questions
        for the day at 8am.
