          <strong>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</strong>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all work together to create a fully functional webpage. HTML makes up the structure of the website and consists of most of the content/writing you see on your web page. CSS is the styling aspect of the web page and JavaScript is what creates functional interactions on the web page.
</p>
<p>
For example, HTML is similar to the structure of a house that is being built. HTML would make up all the timber, flooring, walls, and everything else that makes up a basic house. To make the house more visually appealing, we’re going to add CSS! In this case, CSS would be equal to painting and decorating the house with furniture to create a more homely aesthetic. What about JavaScript? How does JavaScript play a part in this too? You can think of JavaScript as the link between a light switch and a light bulb. We need JavaScript to create a functional interaction that makes the light turn on and off in our house. You can have simple HTML without CSS and JavaScript, but all three work together very well to create the optimal output for web page users.

          <strong>Control flow and loops</strong>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>
          Control flow is the order in which the code is executed. In programming, the code is always executed from the bottom of the document upwards. This means that any code towards the bottom of the document could override code with similar properties towards the top of the document. In programming we also use loops if we want the code to be executed over and over again.
</p>
<p>
For example, control flow is similar to that of making a dessert, there are specific steps that you need to take in order to reach the result of making the dessert and you always complete these steps in a certain order. Now let’s say you have three events on the same day that require you to take a dessert with you as a kind gesture. In this case, you’re going to need to complete the same steps for the recipe three times just like with a loop.

          <strong>What is the DOM and how do we interact with it?</strong>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>
          The DOM is simply a representation of the objects and elements that make up a web page.
          </p>
          <p>
          You can access the DOM via DevTools by right clicking and then selecting the 'inspect' option from the dropdown menu. In the elements tab you'll see all of the HTML elements that make up the web page. As this is just a representation/ how the web browser interprets the page, you can edit the elements but the changes won't be permanent.
         </p>
         <p> You're able to edit HTML and CSS elements directly in the DOM or you can use JavaScript in the console to make changes to HTML, CSS, and create functions on the web page. Again, all changes made in the DOM are not permanent but you can use it to preview changes and interact with the page.</p>

          <strong>Arrays and objects</strong>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>Arrays and objects both play crucial parts in JavaScript, however the way they work differs slightly. An array is very similar to a numbered grocery list, you start your grocery list with a heading and created a list of items that you’re needing to buy. The heading represents the variable you create in JavaScript and the list of food items represent the contents of your array. I also mentioned that your grocery list is numbered, the numbers represent the index positions of each array item making it easy to locate and define the items within the array. On the other hand, we have objects which are very similar to a basic profile for a person or object. For example, this profile may be for Jim and will consist of a few facts about Jim such as his age, gender, and ethnicity. Objects are basically used to store information about a specific thing or person so the information can be used on the web page.</p>

          <strong>What are functions and why are they useful?</strong>
          </div>
          <br>
          <p>Functions are a block of code that are designed to perform a particular task. You write up this block of code which is essentially the input, and then you call this code to create an output on the web page. You can think of writing the function as wiring the light switch in your house, and calling the code is turning on the light switch to produce the desired output. The great thing about functions is that they can be repeatedly used to create the same output wherever you like on the web page! Similar to wiring multiple light switches in your home for the same output when you flick on different switches.
