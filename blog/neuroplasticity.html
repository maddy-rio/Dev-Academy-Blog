        <strong>How the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people:</strong>
        Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity is really powerful
        because brain plasticity refers to the brains ability to adapt and
        change through experiences. This can be so effective for learning,
        mental health, and re-training your brain after an accident. A lot of
        people believe you’re born with a skill set or way of thinking and
        that’s final, whereas realistically your way of thinking and knowledge
        can be changed and moulded in so many positive ways with persistence and
        practice. I can link this to my self development journey over the last
        few years and know first hand how effective re-training your thinking
        and adapting to a growth mindset can be.

        >
        An example of utilising neuroplasticity could be simply taking this Dev
        Academy course as a fresh student with no prior knowledge of coding.
        Each day I’m showing up and learning new skills and terms I haven’t
        previously heard of before. It’s hard work but the more practice, and
        focus I put into these new skills, the stronger this new neural pathway
        will become and be easier for my brain to recognise.

          >What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</strong
        >

        The best way to increase neuroplasticity is to practice what you’re
        trying to learn or the habit you’re trying to incorporate in your daily
        routine. The more often you repeat a certain behaviour, the stronger
        this new neural pathway gets. The opposite goes for behaviours that you
        no longer want to continue, the less you do these behaviours, the weaker
        that neural pathway gets. It’s also helpful to be aware of the
        behaviours or skills you want to build and how you’re going to achieve
        this for the most success.

        - I found this resource particularly useful as it connected my
        experience of rewiring my brain and mindset in terms of mental health to
        really change my life and how I felt. I can also now see how
        neuroplasticity can be linked to learning and other areas of life. I
        didn’t actually know what the term neuroplasticity meant before this
        course but I have used this process to rewire my brain and way of
        thinking for the better so it’s great to be able to link it to a proper
        term.

      <br />
      <p class="main-blocks">
        <strong>What is a growth mindset and why is it relevant?</strong> -
        Growth mindset is SO important in terms of everyday learning and how you
        react to different situations. Having a growth mindset means that when
        you face challenges and setbacks in life you believe that you can still
        achieve your goals and develop the skills you need to reach those goals
        - you believe that your abilities can be improved and aren’t permanent.
        Someone with a fixed mindset views challenges and setbacks in the
        opposite way and often thinks the challenges are too difficult to
        overcome or that they’re simply not smart enough and that’s how it is.

          you?</strong
        >
        - For the past while during my self-development journey I have become
        very aware of growth mindsets vs fixed mindsets and how important this
        is in terms of learning and how you view life. I think this is a great
        thing to be teaching in this course and it’s important that more people
        and adolescents in particular are educated on this as it’s something I
        really struggled with as a young kid. I was so caught up in having good
        grades as a kid and being afraid to fail that I would get really upset
        and give up if I couldn’t be perfect at school which is the perfect
        example of having a fixed mindset. It wasn’t until after high school
        that I started learning more about mindset and how it affects your
        well-being that I realised I can change my mindset to be more open and
        that would in turn improve my mental health too.

        >
        - Reminding myself all the time that there’s nothing wrong with the
        stage I’m at and the only person I should compare my learning to is my
        own. We’re all on different learning journeys and have started at
        different points and should be proud of where we’re all at right now. A
        lot of what I need is that positive self talk to remind myself that I
        can do this and the challenges are all part of the learning journey
        here. Even just writing this I’m realising that I have been more caught
        up and anxious about the future but I need to enjoy the learning I’m
        doing right now because this is all exciting.

        - This is the resource used in the course but I had already watched this
        video previous to starting Dev Academy I guess to hype myself up as I
        was quitting my job and jumping into something completely new. It’s
        honestly amazing how powerful mindset changes can be and this part of
        the course came at the perfect time to remind me to be more present and
        believe in myself through this course.

        - Having a better understanding on neuroplasticity and growth mindset
        has been great and the refresher I needed to make sure I’m supporting
        myself and believing in myself through this process. The better your
        mindset, the easier it is to achieve what you need to do. It has also
        reminded me that the more I practice the new habits I’m trying to
        implement, the easier they will become. It has also reminded me to be
        more in the present with everything including my learning and not get
        distracted as your learning or conversation really flows when you put in
        the attention and focus.
