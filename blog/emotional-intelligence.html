        <strong>What is Emotional Intelligence?</strong>
        Emotional Intelligence is the ability to manage and understand your own
        emotions and the emotions of people around you. People with good
        Emotional Intelligence are also able to express their emotions in a
        healthy and controlled way, which improves stress, communication and
        relationships with others.

        <strong>How is EQ different to IQ?</strong>

        EQ (Emotional Quotient) is the complete opposite to IQ (Intelligence
        Quotient). EQ refers to your ability to recognise and express emotions
        for yourself and others, whereas IQ refers to someone's intellectual
        ability eg. Problem solving. EQ is able to be worked on and improved
        with self-awareness, however IQ is thought to be more challenging to
        improve.

        <strong>Why is EQ important?</strong>

        Emotional Intelligence is an extremely desirable skill and is often
        deemed more important than IQ overall. People with good Emotional
        Intelligence often have social skills and the ability to manage their
        emotions well which means they'll not only be really balanced
        individuals, they'll also be great in both co-operative and stressful
        situations.
