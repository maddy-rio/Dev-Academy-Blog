          due to the core learning?
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        First thing is that I’m very stubborn and good at trying to work things
        out myself as opposed to asking for help - I feel like this is just so
        easy to lean in to with online and self learning but I need to make sure
        I actively ask for help during bootcamp as that will be a completely
        different ball game. Second thing is that self reflection is so
        important to help regulate our emotions and check in with ourself, too
        often I forget to have some valuable self care time and make sure I’m
        doing ok. Lastly, I’m starting to learn more about what’s important to
        me in terms of my future and values which is a really good feeling.

          >What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?</strong
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        here are a number of ways values, empathy, and self-awareness play a
        part in programming. These are very valuable skills when it comes to
        communicating with your team members, leaders and also problem solving.
        It’s also important to use these skills to create a safe and welcoming
        environment with your peers.

        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        How valuable the content of the core learning has actually been and how
        I’ve been able to connect it to my own health journey. I knew it would
        be valuable and this is one of the reasons I chose Dev-Academy to study
        through. I really wanted to touch on the collaborative and emotional
        skills I need to learn in order to work well in a team. I just didn’t
        know it would be this impactful.

          >What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        I think actually opening up with myself and getting to know myself a bit
        better was a challenge in itself but a good one at that. I’m looking
        forward to doing more of this and hopefully doing some core learning
        with others in bootcamp!

      <p class="main-blocks">
        <strong
          >Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Because core includes important skills that actually help you
        communicate and collaborate with others in a team environment which is
        so important in programming. It’s also important to be in tact with
        emotions and self regulation as programming can be a rollercoaster of
        emotions at times so it’s good to know how to recognise and deal with
        those emotions in a healthy way.

        <strong
          >Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time?</strong
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
        Justify your answer. It absolutely does not feel like a waste of time.
        The core skills are extremely valuable and can often be harder to learn
        than the skills of a job itself. Not many education providers focus on
        this aspect of learning so it’s great to see a place that does and I
        think we will all thank you for this when entering a job or even just in
        personal relationships. I do feel pretty rusty on the JavaScript and am
        still wrapping my head around some concepts but I believe the JavaScript
        should be endless in Bootcamp so I’ll get plenty of practice.
